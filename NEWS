CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.2
+ coverageOverRanges() can be allowed to produce NAs for uneven ranges in the
output

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.1
+ coverageOverRanges() matches the order of input ranges and output matrix for
options merge_all_replicates and merge_replicates_per_condition

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
+ Released to Bioconductor version 3.14

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.10
+ coverageOverRanges() now supports mean and sum as combination method. Dpending
on the returnOption, mean/ sum are computed over ranges or replicates.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.9
+ BSFDataSet() and BSFDataSetFromBigWig() now check the path to the bigwig
files in the meta data for potential duplicates
+ coverageOverRanges() now supports also ranges with different width, if
returnOption = `merge_positions_keep_replicates`
+ Fix bug in makeBindingSites(); The minWidth parameter is now implemented as
true lower boundary (>= instead of >). The default has changed from 2 to 3.
+ Fix description in makeBindingSites(); The minCrosslinks parameter describes
the number of positions covered by crosslink events, instead of the total
number of crosslinks.
+ Updated color scheme in rangeCoveragePlot(); and changed position of indicator
box
+ Updated visual of reproducibiliyCutoffPlot() function


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.8
+ Updated coverageOverRange(), Function now does support different output
formats, summarizing the coverage differently over range, replicates and
condition

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.1 - 0.99.7
+ Fix bugs for Bioconductor submission

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.0 (2021-05-15)
+ Submitted to Bioconductor
